## 🧠 Project Overview

This interactive web app predicts **Medical Insurance Charges** for an individual based on their:

* **Age**
* **BMI**
* **Smoking Status**

The model is trained using a regression algorithm and saved as `best_model.pkl`.
The app uses Streamlit to provide a clean and user-friendly interface for instant predictions.
